      value: "Where the Tower now stands was the site of the four villas originally
        purchased by University College for \xA335,000 to provide their initial accommodation.
        A corridor was constructed to link them at the rear, and they provided the
        original teaching space for most subjects. It was also in one of them that
        Prof D'Arcy Thompson created a museum for his impressive zoology collection,
        the remains of which are now housed in a museum in the Carnelley Building.
        It had always been the intention to knock these down and build something more
        elaborate, and various schemes were considered, but St Andrews University
        (who held the purse-strings) were always reluctant to come up with the money.
        In 1951, however, a Royal Commission was set up under Lord Tedder to look
        at the increasingly strained relationship between Dundee and St Andrews. The
        result of Tedder's report was that University College was dissolved and reformed
        in 1954 as Queen's College. The new Principal at St Andrews, Thomas Malcolm
        Knox, believed Dundee was just as important as St Andrews, and though he was
        initially in favour of unity, ultimately became the driving force behind Dundee's
        bid for independence. It was Knox who suggested the Tower building as a symbol
        of the strength and modernity of Dundee, and it was he who laid the foundation
        stone in 1959. The design by Sir Robert Matthew was certainly modern (the
        first tower block in Dundee) but made links with the past in its materials
        - not concrete but traditional stone and wood. The building was opened in
        1961 by the Queen Mother, and the extension was completed seven years later."
