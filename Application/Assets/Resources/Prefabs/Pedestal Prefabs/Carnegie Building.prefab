      value: "We are standing now in one of the most attractive parts of the university
        campus, the Geddes quadrangle. It was begun in 1909 and more or less completed
        in 1913 with the opening of what is now the Harris Building. The quadrangle
        is named after Patrick Geddes, undoubtedly one of the most important academics
        to have taught at Dundee. He was born in 1854, grew up in Perth and began
        his career as a botany demonstrator in Edinburgh. He had truly radical ideas,
        however, and believed that the lessons of biology could be applied on a wider
        scale to people, and in particular to the social and physical problems of
        city life. He became intensely interested in the evolution of cities - how
        they worked and why they failed to work. He is regarded now as the father
        of town planning, and led various schemes to improve conditions in Edinburgh,
        including founding the Edinburgh Social Union. Just a few months after his
        arrival at University College, the Dundee Social Union was founded on the
        same model, and proved to be enormously influential in exposing problems in
        the city.\r\n\r\nBecause he was so outspoken he failed to win a chair at Edinburgh
        University in 1882, but at that time the new UCD was appointing its first
        professors and not long after, an enterprising patron (Martin White) endowed
        a part-time Chair of Botany specifically for Geddes. This was typical of the
        College's intentions - UCD was not going to be another Oxford or Cambridge,
        but a modem, innovative, scientific university. Like Geddes, most of the professors
        were in their early 30s or under (the first Principal was only 26), and all
        were dynamic, enthusiastic personalities. This focus was evident in their
        building programme - the first new buildings to be constructed on campus were
        a chemistry lab, a medical school, a gymnasium, a physics lab and an engineering
        lab.\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable that Geddes would interest himself in planning
        the expansion of the university, and one of his first ideas, apparently, was
        a quadrangle in this location, behind the two houses Ellenbank and Union Mount.
        He originally envisaged a complete four-sided quad like that in Edinburgh,
        or the Marischal College in Aberdeen. That plan was thwarted when the wealthy
        banker Robert Fleming paid for a gymnasium and squash courts on the south
        west comer. The plan was modified, therefore, to create a physics building
        on the east side and an engineering lab on the north.\r\n\r\nIn the early
        years of the 20th century, therefore, the College Council let it be known
        that any wealthy benefactors willing to endow a new science block would not
        be unwelcome. One who did come forward was James Caird. His proposal was for
        an enormous building which would have extended right out onto Perth Road -
        not what the College had in mind at all (not least because they'd just spent
        quite a lot purchasing Ellenbank and Union Mount). They turned down Caird's
        extremely generous offer and\r\n\r\ninstead accepted a rather less generous
        offer from Andrew Carnegie, Rector of St Andrews and Dundee at the time. He
        offered \xA312,500 for a Physics building, and the College set about creating
        something special. Rather than employing a local architect (as was usually
        the case) they went for Scotland's leading architect Sir Rowand Anderson to
        design the building, though in fact he passed most of the work over to his
        assistant Balfour Paul. Paul went for a neo-17th century Scots classicist
        design, allowing classical motifs but without being restricted to the symmetry
        of Palladian style neo-classicism.\r\n\r\nPhysics (or Natural Philosophy as
        it was then called) was originally taught by the Mathematics professor Steggall,
        but in 1895 a separate chair of Physics was awarded to J P Kuenen from the
        Netherlands. He had a considerable influence on the design of the Carnegie
        building, adding various functional features such as the proviso that no iron
        should be used in its construction to avoid interference with magnetic experiments.
        The building was opened in 1909 by JJ Thomson, famous for his discovery of
        the electron.\r\n\r\nAmong the first students to have worked here was Robert
        Alexander Watson Watt, who had studied engineering and was then taken on as
        an assistant by Peddie who personally tutored him through a postgraduate course
        on radio waves. He later became famous as the pioneer of RADAR, and it was
        due to his influence that the Air Ministry based their RADAR research team
        here during the war.\r\n\r\nIt had always been intended that the engineering
        lab would be designed by the same architects, Anderson & Paul, but have its
        own unique characteristics. The original intention was for the two buildings
        to be joined, but Kuenen had rejected that. He wanted to have his big electricity
        generators in this comer and thought that if the buildings were attached the
        vibrations might affect his experiments. The Peters High Tension Laboratory
        was therefore constructed for Electrical Engineering. Named in honour of a
        former Dean of Guild, whose sisters had endowed it, it was designed by Mills
        & Shepherd and opened in 1910 by Ernest Rutherford, later famous as the father
        of nuclear physics.\r\n\r\nThe gardens, meanwhile, were laid out by Patrick
        Geddes, who put into practice his belief that \"the buildings and their garden
        must stand or be changed together, as the permanently related parts of a larger
        artistic unity.\" He planted each flower bed with a different scientific group,
        arranged in such a way as to show the evolution of that group. He used these
        and other gardens around the campus for teaching purposes. Although no photos
        have been found to prove this, he is said to have arranged the paths in the
        shape of a swastika, at that time (before it was appropriated by the Nazis)
        a symbol of life and well-being.\r\n\r\nThe sundial in the centre of the quadrangle
        was designed by Kuenen\u2019s successor as Professor of Physics, William Peddie,
        and erected in 1914 as a memorial of the visit to Dundee by the British Association
        for the Advancement of Science two years earlier."
